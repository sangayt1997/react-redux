# Redux Project

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites for React 
- Node.js: React is built with JavaScript and runs on Node.js, so you will need to have it installed to use React. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/) or through a package manager such as Homebrew (for macOS) or Chocolatey (for Windows).

- npm / yarn (Node Package Manager): npm / yarn is a package manager for Node.js that comes bundled with it. It is used to install and manage packages (libraries, frameworks, etc.) that you will use in your project.

- A code editor: You will need a code editor to write your code. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code(Free Software IDE) and webstorm.

- A web browser: You will need a web browser to test your application. Any modern browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge will work.

- That's it! Once you have these tools installed, you are ready to start building a React project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `yarn install`
- Install all the packages and it's dependencies in the project.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will
remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right
into your project, so you have full control over them. All the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will
point to the copied scripts, so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you
shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t
customize it when you are ready for it.
